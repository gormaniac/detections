# ClamAV Rules

I'm trying to learn ClamAV, and I'd like to share any rules I come up, so they're saved here.

## Naming Conventions

Mostly follow the official naming convention documented [here](https://docs.clamav.net/manual/Signatures/SignatureNames.html). However, instead of using `Hunting` in the "Platform" part of the signame, I prepend `Hunting` to the "Name" part of the signame followed by a period. This way, additional details about the rule are still available.
