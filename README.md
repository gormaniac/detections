# detections

Various yara/clamav/sigma rules I've written

All detections are stored in the `src` directory, separated out by engine type. And are further separated out by types of files/malware they're intended for.

I try to keep a consistent naming scheme, and keep the number of rules/file to a minimum. Naming schemes are described in per engine doc pages.
